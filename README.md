This is a technical test for android programming. 

The code is not packaged yet, I did not know if I had to package it.

At the moment Android studio is needed to run the app
The app is written in Java,
It uses the SharedPreferences API, Room Database, ViewPager layout for walkthrough page

User will have to enter username and password at initial start,
  - These do not have a specific structure, entering any sequence of characters(Stings) of an length will be accepted
  - An error is thrown if the user does leaves either of the input fields blank
 
User have to keep on skipping the welcome screen at launch
At log out the "remeber me" is reset therefore user has to enter new choice
